"""

DO not modify the structure of "class Agent".
Implement the functions of this class.
Look at the file run.py to understand how evaluations are done. 

There are two phases of evaluation:
- Training Phase
The methods "registered_reset_train" and "compute_action_train" are invoked here. 
Complete these functions to train your agent and save the state.

- Test Phase
The methods "registered_reset_test" and "compute_action_test" are invoked here. 
The final scoring is based on your agent's performance in this phase. 
Use the state saved in train phase here.
